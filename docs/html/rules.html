<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_2_2_2_rules_for_jakarta_mail_api_products">2.2.2 Rules for Jakarta Mail API Products</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following rules apply for each version of an operating system,
software component, and hardware platform Documented as supporting the
Product:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mail1</strong> The Product must be able to satisfy all applicable compatibility
requirements, including passing all Conformance Tests, in every Product
Configuration and in every combination of Product Configurations, except
only as specifically exempted by these Rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if a Product provides distinct Operating Modes to optimize
performance, then that Product must satisfy all applicable compatibility
requirements for a Product in each Product Configuration, and
combination of Product Configurations, of those Operating Modes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mail1.1</strong> If an Operating Mode controls a Resource necessary for the
basic execution of the Test Suite, testing may always use a Product
Configuration of that Operating Mode providing that Resource, even if
other Product Configurations do not provide that Resource.
Notwithstanding such exceptions, each Product must have at least one set
of Product Configurations of such Operating Modes that is able to pass
all the Conformance Tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, a Product with an Operating Mode that controls a security
policy (i.e., Security Resource) which has one or more Product
Configurations that cause Conformance Tests to fail may be tested using
a Product Configuration that allows all Conformance Tests to pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mail1.2</strong> A Product Configuration of an Operating Mode that causes the
Product to report only version, usage, or diagnostic information is
exempted from these compatibility rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mail1.3</strong> An API Definition Product is exempt from all functional
testing requirements defined here, except the signature tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mail2</strong> Some Conformance Tests may have properties that may be changed.
Properties that can be changed are identified in the configuration
interview. Properties that can be changed are identified in the JavaTest
Environment (.jte) files in the Test Suite
installation. Apart from changing such properties and other allowed
modifications described in this User&#8217;s Guide (if any), no source or
binary code for a Conformance Test may be altered in any way without
prior written permission. Any such allowed alterations to the
Conformance Tests will be provided via the Jakarta EE Specification Project
website and apply to all vendor compatible implementations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mail3</strong> The testing tools supplied as part of the Test Suite or as
updated by the Maintenance Lead must be used to certify compliance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mail4</strong> The Exclude List associated with the Test Suite cannot be
modified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mail5</strong> The Maintenance Lead can define exceptions to these Rules. Such
exceptions would be made available as above, and will apply to all vendor implementations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mail6</strong> All hardware and software component additions, deletions, and
modifications to a Documented supporting hardware/software platform,
that are not part of the Product but required for the Product to satisfy
the compatibility requirements, must be Documented and available to
users of the Product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if a patch to a particular version of a supporting
operating system is required for the Product to pass the Conformance
Tests, that patch must be Documented and available to users of the
Product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mail7</strong> The Product must contain the full set of public and protected
classes and interfaces for all the Libraries. Those classes and
interfaces must contain exactly the set of public and protected methods,
constructors, and fields defined by the Specifications for those
Libraries. No subsetting, supersetting, or modifications of the public
and protected API of the Libraries are allowed except only as
specifically exempted by these Rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mail7.1</strong> If a Product includes Technologies in addition to the
Technology Under Test, then it must contain the full set of combined
public and protected classes and interfaces. The API of the Product
must contain the union of the included Technologies. No further
modifications to the APIs of the included Technologies are allowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mail8</strong> Except for tests specifically required by this TCK to be rebuilt
(if any), the binary Conformance Tests supplied as part of the Test
Suite or as updated by the Maintenance Lead must be used to certify
compliance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Mail9</strong> The functional programmatic behavior of any binary class or
interface must be that defined by the Specifications.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jakarta has a well established process for managing challenges to its
TCKs. Any implementor may submit a challenge to one or more tests in the
Jakarta Mail TCK as it relates to their implementation.  Implementor
means the entity as a whole in charge of producing the final certified release.
<strong>Challenges filed should represent the consensus of that entity</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_2_3_1_valid_challenges">2.3.1 Valid Challenges</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any test case (e.g., test class, @Test method), test case configuration (e.g., deployment descriptor), test beans, annotations, and other resources considered part of the TCK may be challenged.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following scenarios are considered in scope for test challenges:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Claims that a test assertion conflicts with the specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claims that a test asserts requirements over and above that of the specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claims that an assertion of the specification is not sufficiently implementable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claims that a test is not portable or depends on a particular implementation.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_2_3_2_invalid_challenges">2.3.2 Invalid Challenges</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following scenarios are considered out of scope for test challenges and will be immediately closed if filed:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Challenging an implementationâs claim of passing a test.  Certification is an honor system and these issues must be raised directly with the implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenging the usefulness of a specification requirement.  The challenge process cannot be used to bypass the specification process and raise in question the need or relevance of a specification requirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claims the TCK is inadequate or missing assertions required by the specification.  See the Improvement section, which is outside the scope of test challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenges that do not represent a consensus of the implementing community will be closed until such time that the community does agree or agreement cannot be made.  The test challenge process is not the place for implementations to initiate their own internal discussions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenges to tests that are already excluded for any reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenges that an excluded test should not have been excluded and should be re-added should be opened as a new enhancement request</p>
</li>

<p>Specification project evaluates the challenge.<br>
Challenges can be resolved by a specification project lead, or a project challenge triage team, after a consensus of the specification project committers is reached or attempts to gain consensus fails.
Specification projects may exercise lazy consensus, voting or any practice that follows the principles of Eclipse Foundation Development Process.
The expected timeframe for a response is two weeks or less.
If consensus cannot be reached by the specification project for a prolonged period of time, the default recommendation is to exclude the tests and address the dispute in a future revision of the specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepted Challenges.<br>
A consensus that a test produces invalid results will result in the exclusion of that test from certification requirements, and an immediate update and release of an official distribution of the TCK including the new exclude list. The associated <code>challenge</code> issue must be closed with an <code>accepted</code> label to indicate it has been resolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rejected Challenges and Remedy.<br>
When a`challenge` issue is rejected, it must be closed with a label of <code>invalid</code> to indicate it has been rejected.
There appeal process for challenges rejected on technical terms is outlined in Escalation Appeal.
If, however, an implementer feels the TCK challenge process was not followed, an appeal issue should be filed with specification projectâs TCK issue tracker using the label <code>challenge-appeal</code>.
A project lead should escalate the issue with the Jakarta EE Specification Committee via email (<a href="mailto:jakarta.ee-spec@eclipse.org">jakarta.ee-spec@eclipse.org</a>).
The committee will evaluate the matter purely in terms of due process.
If the appeal is accepted, the original TCK challenge issue will be reopened and a label of <code>appealed-challenge</code> added, along with a discussion of the appeal decision, and the <code>challenge-appeal</code> issue with be closed.
If the appeal is rejected, the <code>challenge-appeal</code> issue should closed with a label of <code>invalid</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Escalation Appeal.<br>
If there is a concern that a TCK process issue has not been resolved satisfactorily, the
<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/#6_5_Grievance_Handling">Eclipse Development Process Grievance Handling</a> procedure should be followed to escalate the resolution. Note that this is not a mechanism to attempt to handle implementation specific issues.</p>
